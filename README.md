### Team Members
* Son Pham, Kyle Rogers, Reiko Matsuda-dunn, Ryan Karasopoulos  

### Project Description
* This project focuses on individual susceptibility to misinformation regarding COVID-19. Possible predictors include:
    - How information was communicated
    - Reactions of governments to the pandemic
    - Attitudes and risk perceptions people had towards the virus
    - Trust in science and/or journalists
    - Political ideology

### Summary of questions and answers
* Questions: The major questions to answer:
    - How digital communications influenced peopleâ€™s interpretation of the news
    - Did susceptibility to misinformation predict the responses to the new laws and mandates
    - Beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 versus other world issues
    - The similarity and trends among the different countries
    
* Answers:
* 

### Application of gained knowledge

* Those prone to misinformation come from a wide variety of national and political backgrounds; political beliefs and nationality are not good indicators of susceptibility to misinformation
* Trust levels in various social groups were some of the most powerful indicators of susceptibility to misinformation
* More nuanced studies need to be conducted to find the degree to which social trust impacts misunderstanding of scientific data
* A repeat of this study using the same participants would help understand how viewpoints change in light of evolving information
